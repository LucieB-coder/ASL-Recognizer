# ASL Recognizer

ASL_Recognizer is a small AI project designed to enable real-time detection of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures with transcription into text. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to recognize hand gestures from images and transcribe them into corresponding text.

## Dataset

We utilize the American Sign Language dataset available at Roboflow. This dataset contains a diverse range of ASL gestures captured in various environments and lighting conditions.

## Technologies Used

* Keras: We use Keras, a high-level neural networks API, for building and training our deep learning models. Keras provides a user-friendly interface for constructing complex neural networks efficiently.
* JAX: JAX is a numerical computing library that offers high-performance and automatic differentiation for machine learning algorithms. We leverage JAX to optimize our model training process and improve computational efficiency.
